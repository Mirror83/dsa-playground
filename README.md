# DSA Playground

This repository is meant for working through some DSA questions,
and exploring alternate solutions.

The language being used to solve the problems is Kotlin.

For now, I'll be updating it periodically as I work through
[my fork of the 52 weeks of DSA](https://github.com/Mirror83/52_Weeks_of_DSA) repository.

The first problem in this repo is the [palindrome-linked-list](./questions/linked-list/palindrome-linked-list.md).
The code can be found in the `linked-list` package.
